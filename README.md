architectural. However, the concept of accessibility has expanded to other areas.
related to the promotion of quality of life for all people. Accessibility refers to,
also to ensure that everyone has access to information and communication.

It is relatively easy for a person without limitations or disabilities to navigate the Web. You can use the mouse, see the screen, look for the information you want, concentrate on the central areas of the content, watch videos, in short, everything is quick and easy.
